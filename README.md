# MQTT Scroller for the Pimoroni Stellar Unicon with Pi Pico W

MQTT Scroller and Laser Cut Front for the Pimoroni Stellar Unicon with Pi Pico W

An edited version of the Pimoroni Text Scroll to connect to Wifi and subscribe to an MQTT feed. This enables messages to be scrolled via any MQTT broker. 

The code is set up around our THE: Time, Headlines and Envivronmental Information stream, this links in feeds from our own MQTT server, providing details on the time, news, weather and earthquake information. You can choose to leave this in place or add your own MQTT feed. The code uses different coloured backgrounds for different text in feeds - ie News, Weather, Time, you can edit these accordingly to match your own feed.
